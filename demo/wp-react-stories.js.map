Because React wraps all user-provided\n  // functions in invokeGuardedCallback, and the production version of\n  // invokeGuardedCallback uses a try-catch, all user exceptions are treated\n  // like caught exceptions, and the DevTools won't pause unless the developer\n  // takes the extra step of enabling pause on caught exceptions. This is\n  // untintuitive, though, because even though React has caught the error, from\n  // the developer's perspective, the error is uncaught.\n  //\n  // To preserve the expected \"Pause on exceptions\" behavior, we don't use a\n  // try-catch in DEV. Instead, we synchronously dispatch a fake event to a fake\n  // DOM node, and call the user-provided callback from inside an event handler\n  // for that fake event. If the callback throws, the error is \"captured\" using\n  // a global event handler. But because the error happens in a different\n  // event loop context, it does not interrupt the normal program flow.\n  // Effectively, this gives us try-catch behavior without actually using\n  // try-catch.
